Finish key types:
    aes
    aes.encrypted
    dsa
    dsa.public
    hmac
    rsa
    rsa-sign
    rsa-sign.public

Build KeyCzar main API
   Crypter
   Signer
   what are the other main classes?

Refactor common code
    duplicate code in newFOOkeys

keymeta.keys[keyid] = key
keymeta.primary is uint32 keyid

Fix up API to have 'err' return codes
    => and full error checking 
    => better error messages?  "bad version 0x4 in header" vs. "bad version in header"

Fix API to only expose things that actually need to be exposed

Make sure we have real tests cases
    Add test cases for:
        EncodeWeb64String
        DecodeWeb64String

isPurpose checking at Crypter (or whatever) construction time

function to split a stream into
   header, iv, ciphertext, signature

type header {
   uint8 version
   uint32 keyid
}

HMAC key needs signing functionality

Output format: 0.5b or 0.6b ?
   header|msg|sign(msg . VERSION)
      or
   header|msg|sign(header|msg)
   Need to be able to detect and verify both versions?
   VERSION == 1 => 0.5b
   VERSION == 0 => 0.6b
