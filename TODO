Finish key types:
    rsa
    rsa-sign
    rsa-sign.public

Refactor common code
    duplicate code in newFOOkeys

keymeta.keys[keyid] = key
keymeta.primary is uint32 keyid

Fix up API to have 'err' return codes
    => and full error checking 
    => better error messages?  "bad version 0x4 in header" vs. "bad version in header"

Make sure we have real tests cases
    Add test cases for:
        encodeWeb64String
        decodeWeb64String

function to split a stream into
   header, iv, ciphertext, signature

type header struct {
   uint8 version
   uint32 keyid
}

Output format: 0.5b or 0.6b ?
   header|msg|sign(msg . VERSION)
      or
   header|msg|sign(header|msg)
   Need to be able to detect and verify both versions?
   VERSION == 1 => 0.5b
   VERSION == 0 => 0.6b

Separate json objects from our actual internal crypto types?
Use json attributes on structs rather than naming?

Split code better among the files:
    pull pkcs5pad into util
    any other pending reorgs?

Cache key id so it's only calculated once at key load time?
