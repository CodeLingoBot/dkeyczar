This was basically a proof-of-concept, hacked up in a weekend.  There's still a
lot of work to do, but at the moment AES-HMAC for encryption and HMAC_SHA1 and DSA for
signing and verification.  There's a list of TODO items, many of which are source code
cleanup tasks, not just missing functionality.

At the moment, the tests require the keyczar-py source tree, since that's where
the test files are kept.  The path is currently hardcoded to my machine --
you'll want to fix that before running "make test"
