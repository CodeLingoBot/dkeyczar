You can learn more about the Keyczar library at http://www.keyczar.org/

The library is still in development but should be mostly complete.  You can
currently load AES, HMAC, RSA, and DSA keys and use them for signing and
verification.  RSA public and private keys can be loaded from PEM files as well
as keyczar key files.  The library also supports creating session keys.

At the moment, the tests require the keyczar-cpp source tree, since that's
where the test files are kept.  The path to the 06b testfiles must be specified
in the KEYCZAR_TESTDATA environment variable.
