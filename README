This was basically a proof-of-concept, hacked up in a week.  There's still a
lot of clean-ups required to get it ready for production, but at the moment all
the Keyczar keytypes are supported for encryption, decryption, signing and
verification.

At the moment, the tests require the keyczar-py source tree, since that's where
the test files are kept.  This path can be specified in the KEYCZAR_TESTDATA
environment variable.
