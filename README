You can learn more about the Keyczar library at http://www.keyczar.org/

The library supports:
   AES+HMAC for symmetric encryption,
   HMAC for symmetric signing
   RSA for asymmetric encryption or signing
   DSA for asymmetric signing

It uses sensible defaults for key sizes and all output is encoding in web-safe
base64.

See the godoc for more information.  It is also viewable online at:
http://gopkgdoc.appspot.com/pkg/github.com/dgryski/dkeyczar

At the moment, the tests require the keyczar-cpp source tree, since that's
where the test files are kept.  The path to the 06b testfiles must be specified
in the KEYCZAR_TESTDATA environment variable.
